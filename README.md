An H-Gantry RepRap 3d Printer. Designed with Python/FreeCAD

# Overall Design Goals
This is a RepRap printer in so far as it can replicate many of it's parts.  
It has a low MachineSize to PrintArea ratio.
Printable STL's and a BOM is output by a FreeCAD Macro.
It's frame is t-slot extrusions and can currently be built with 15mm OpenBeam or 20mm Misumi extrusions.
The design is parametric with regard to overall print area.

# Status
I've built this machine as configured by default and it is working.
Mechanics are solid and acurate.
Still working and getting great settings for the extruders.
I'm waiting on a relay that I'll use for the bed heater. Waiting for the bed to heat up has cost me a ton of time.

Not all of the printed parts are properly placed for printing in the STL files.  
So check the orientation before printing anything.
I'm working on cleaning up the code and I'll make some basic instructions for using the script very soon.
