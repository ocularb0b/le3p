An H-Gantry RepRap 3d Printer. Designed with FreeCAD

# Overall Design Goals
-This is a RepRap printer in so far as it can replicate many of it's parts  
-Very low MachineSize to PrintArea ratio
-Printable STL's and a BOM is output by a FreeCAD Macro
-It's frame is t-slot extrusions and can currently be built with 15mm OpenBeam or 20mm Misumi extrusions
-The design is parametric with regard to overall print area.

# Status
I've built this machine as configured by default and it is working.
